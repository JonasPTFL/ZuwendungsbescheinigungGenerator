This is a simple tool, which automates the genration of pdf files with data from two csv files.
More specific, the tool uses an input pdf and joins the data from the csv files to fill in the input pdf and store it as a new pdf file.
At the end all generated pdf files will be merged into one pdf file.

This is used to generate "Zuwendungsbescheiningungen" ("Spendenbescheinigungen") from member data table and membership fee data table.
